## Introduction

The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** solves the administrative challenge of managing monthly claims for contract lecturers. It replaces manual or disjointed processes with a centralized, user-friendly platform. The application is built using ASP.NET MVC, follows the Model-View-Controller architecture, and is backed by a scalable Azure SQL database. The front-end is designed to be responsive and accessible across various device sizes.

## Key Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure login for Lecturers, Programme Coordinators, and Academic Managers.
* **Claim Submission**: Lecturers can easily create, submit, and track their monthly claims, detailing hours worked and hourly rates.
* **Approval Workflow**: A streamlined process for Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers to review, approve, or reject claims.
* **Data Management**: Centralized storage and management of all claims, user data, and related information.
* **Responsive UI**: A clean and intuitive user interface designed with Figma and built to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern, robust tech stack to ensure scalability and maintainability:

* **Backend**: C# with ASP.NET MVC
* **Database**: Azure SQL
* **UI/UX Design**: Figma
* **Architecture**: Entity Framework, Model-View-Controller (MVC)

---

## Database Design

The database is structured using an Entity-Relationship model, where C# models directly map to Azure SQL tables. This approach leverages the power of Entity Framework for seamless data access and manipulation. The core entities include:

* **Lecturer**: Stores personal details and credentials.
* **Claim**: Contains all information about a specific claim, including hours, rates, and status.
* **ProgrammeCoordinator**: Manages assigned lecturers and reviews claims.
* **AcademicManager**: Holds final approval authority over claims.

Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the system.
